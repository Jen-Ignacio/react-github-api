# Github REST API Application

The development team has all quit along with the last web designer. Among piles of empty Keurig containers they found a list of requirements written on a white board along with two horrible wireframes. It's up to you to finish this last task to complete this project and wrap-up this contract.
1) Make a call to the github.api to display the first 10 users according to id number in a list. Please display the lgoin name and the id for each of those 10 users. Please sort the entries by login name in alpha order.
2) Each entry in the list should be clickable, and when selected should display the full user details as returned from the github api in a user-friendly format. It is also required to track which entries in the list have been clicked and how many times. The number of clicks should be displayed as "Profile Views".
3) The component used to fetch data from the api must be separate from the component used to display the results.
4) Style and layout are at your discretion, but the site should be responsive for mobile devices and support Edge, FireFox, and Chrome.
5) If you wish, you cna add additional features and enhancements (a chart would be nice...), but any changes should not alter the basic requirements listed above.
